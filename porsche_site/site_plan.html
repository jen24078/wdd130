      <h3>911</h3>
      <p>
        The connection to the very first 911, initially designated the "901," is immediately apparent in the 1970 model's silhouette. This was the era of the classic "long hood," a design characterized by its graceful, uninterrupted slope from the windshield to the bumper. This elegant and simple form factor, free of the heavy, impact-absorbing bumpers that would arrive in 1974, is a direct link to Ferdinand "Butzi" Porsche's original 1963 design. The slim profile, delicate chrome trim, and iconic round headlights are all hallmarks of this foundational period.

        Inside, the car retains a minimalist and driver-focused cabin. The five-gauge instrument cluster, with the tachometer placed squarely in the center, established a design language that continues to this day. There is an elegant simplicity to the controls and a sense of direct mechanical connection that was a hallmark of the first 911s.
