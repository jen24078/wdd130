					The original Porsche 911, which debuted in 1963 at the
					Frankfurt Motor Show as the Type 901, immediately
					established the foundational elements of a legendary
					automotive lineage. Penned by Ferdinand Alexander "Butzi"
					Porsche, its iconic design featured a distinctive fastback
					silhouette, round headlights, and a rear-engine layout that
					would become a hallmark of the model for decades to come. At
					its heart was a new 2.0-liter, air-cooled flat-six engine,
					producing 130 horsepower and a soundtrack as characteristic
					as its shape. Inside, the 911 offered a surprisingly
					practical 2+2 seating arrangement, a simple yet
					driver-focused cockpit, and a five-gauge instrument cluster
					that prioritized essential information. This combination of
					timeless design, engaging performance, and everyday
					usability cemented the original 911's status as a true
					sports car for the discerning driver.

				<p>
					Visually an evolution of the classic silhouette, the Type
					964 was a thoroughly modern 911, with Porsche claiming 85%
					of its components were new. This generation introduced
					significant technological advancements, including the option
					of a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system in the Carrera 4
					and the Tiptronic automatic transmission, making the 911
					more accessible to a wider range of drivers. Its 3.6-liter
					air-cooled flat-six engine produced a robust 250 horsepower,
					and the 964 also featured a retractable rear spoiler that
					automatically deployed at speed, preserving the car's clean
					lines when not needed.

				<p>
					Often hailed as the pinnacle of the air-cooled era, the Type
					993 represented a significant aesthetic and mechanical
					refinement of the 911. Its bodywork was smoother and more
					curvaceous, with integrated bumpers and redesigned, more
					aerodynamic headlights giving it a more modern and muscular
					stance. The 3.6-liter flat-six engine, now with a standard
					six-speed manual gearbox, delivered increased power and
					torque. A new multi-link rear suspension improved handling
					and ride comfort, taming some of the challenging
					characteristics of its predecessors and making the 993 a
					more poised and capable machine.

				<p>
					Marking the most radical departure in the 911's history, the
					Type 996 transitioned from air-cooled to a new water-cooled
					flat-six engine, a move made to meet stricter emissions and
					noise regulations. This generation also featured a
					completely redesigned and larger bodyshell, sharing its
					controversial "fried egg" headlights with the entry-level
					Boxster. The 996 brought the 911 into a new era of
					performance and refinement, introducing the first-ever 911
					GT3, a track-focused variant that would become a staple of
					the lineup, and a more powerful Turbo model with standard
					all-wheel drive.

					The Type 997 was a return to form for many Porsche
					enthusiasts, bringing back the classic round headlights and
					a more muscular and purposeful design. It offered a more
					driver-focused interior and introduced a host of new
					technologies, including Porsche Active Suspension Management
					(PASM) as standard on the Carrera S. The second phase of the
					997 saw the introduction of direct fuel injection for
					improved efficiency and power, as well as the acclaimed
					Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) dual-clutch transmission,
					offering lightning-fast gear changes.

				<p>
					The Type 991 was built on an all-new platform with a longer
					wheelbase and wider front track, resulting in enhanced
					stability and cornering prowess. Constructed from a
					lightweight aluminum-steel composite, it was both larger and
					lighter than its predecessor. A significant development
					during this generation was the mid-cycle update that
					introduced turbocharged engines for the standard Carrera
					models, a move aimed at improving fuel economy and reducing
					emissions while still delivering exhilarating performance.
					The 991 also featured the world's first seven-speed manual
					transmission in a passenger car.

				<p>
					The current Type 992 generation blends the timeless 911
					silhouette with a more muscular and technologically advanced
					design, featuring a wide body as standard for all models and
					a distinctive full-width rear LED light bar. The interior is
					dominated by a large central touchscreen and digital
					displays, yet retains a driver-centric layout. The
					turbocharged flat-six engines are more powerful and
					efficient than ever, and the 992 introduces advanced
					driver-assistance systems and a new "Wet Mode" for improved
					safety in slippery conditions, continuing the 911's
					evolution as a cutting-edge, everyday supercar.
